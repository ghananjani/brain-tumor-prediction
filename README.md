# BrainTune : Detecting Brain Tumors

Advanced machine learning model, has been developed to identify brain tumors from medical imaging data with an impressive accuracy rate of 95% on the Kaggle dataset. The primary objective of BrainTune is to assist healthcare professionals in the early detection of brain tumors, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.

## Project Overview 📝

Employs cutting-edge machine learning techniques to analyze medical imaging data, specifically MRI scans, for the accurate detection of brain tumors. By automating this detection process, BrainTune not only reduces the time and effort required for diagnosis but also enables medical professionals to prioritize treatment planning and patient care.

## Data Insights 📊

The model has undergone extensive training and evaluation using a comprehensive dataset generously provided by Kaggle. This dataset encompasses MRI scans from both tumor-afflicted and healthy patients, each image meticulously labeled. These labeled images have enabled BrainTune to learn the subtle patterns and features indicative of brain tumors, contributing to its remarkable accuracy.

## Model Excellence ✨

With an outstanding accuracy rate of 95% on the Kaggle dataset's evaluation set, BrainTune demonstrates its prowess in effectively identifying brain tumors from medical imaging data. However, it is important to emphasize that BrainTune serves as a complementary tool for medical professionals and should never replace expert medical diagnosis.
